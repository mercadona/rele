``RELE``
--------

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)

A dictionary mapping all Rel√© configuration settings to values defined
in your Django project's ``settings.py``.
Example::

    RELE = {
        'GC_CREDENTIALS': service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            'rele/settings/dummy-credentials.json'
        ),
        'GC_PROJECT_ID': 'dummy-project-id',
        'MIDDLEWARE': [
            'rele.contrib.LoggingMiddleware',
            'rele.contrib.DjangoDBMiddleware',
        ],
        'SUB_PREFIX': 'mysubprefix',
        'APP_NAME': 'myappname',
        'ENCODER_PATH': 'rest_framework.utils.encoders.JSONEncoder',
        'ACK_DEADLINE': 120,
        'PUBLISHER_TIMEOUT': 3.0
    }


``GC_CREDENTIALS``
------------------

**Required**

Valid Google Service Account credentials.

``GC_PROJECT_ID``
------------------

**Required**

Valid Google Project ID

``MIDDLEWARE``
------------------

**Optional**

Default: ``['rele.contrib.LoggingMiddleware']``

List of the middleware modules that will be included in the project. The order
of execution follows FIFO.

It is strongly recommended that for Django integration, you add::

    [
        'rele.contrib.LoggingMiddleware',
        'rele.contrib.DjangoDBMiddleware',
    ]

The DjangoDBMiddleware will take care of opening and closing connections to the db before
and after your callbacks are executed. If this is left out, it is highly probable that
your database will run out of connections in your connection pool.

The LoggingMiddleware will take care of logging subscription information before and after the callback is executed.
The subscription message is only logged when an exception was raised while processing it.
If you would like to log this message in every case, you should create a middleware of your own.


``SUB_PREFIX``
------------------

**Optional**

A prefix to all your subs that can be declared globally.

For instance, if you have two projects listening to one topic, you may want to add a
prefix so that there can be two distinct subscribers to that one topic.


``APP_NAME``
------------------

**Optional**

The application name.

This should be unique to all the services running in the application ecosystem. It is used by
the LoggingMiddleware and Prometheus integration.


``ENCODER_PATH``
------------------

**Optional**

Default: `rest_framework.utils.encoders.JSONEncoder <https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/utils/encoders.py#L17>`_

`Encoder class path <https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.JSONEncoder>`_ to use for
serializing your Python data structure to a json object when publishing.

.. note:: The default encoder class is subject to change in an upcoming release.
    It is advised that you use this setting explicitly.

``ACK_DEADLINE``
------------------

**Optional**

Ack deadline for all subscribers in seconds.

.. seealso:: The `Google Pub/Sub documentation <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber>`_
    which states that *The subscriber has a configurable, limited amount of time --
    known as the ackDeadline -- to acknowledge the outstanding message. Once the deadline
    passes, the message is no longer considered outstanding, and Cloud Pub/Sub will attempt
    to redeliver the message.*

.. _settings_publisher_timeout:

``PUBLISHER_TIMEOUT``
---------------------

**Optional**

Default: 3.0 seconds

Timeout that the publishing result will wait on the future to publish successfully while blocking.

`See Google PubSub documentation for more info
<https://googleapis.dev/python/pubsub/1.1.0/publisher/api/futures.html?highlight=result#google.cloud.pubsub_v1.publisher.futures.Future.result>`_

``THREADS_PER_SUBSCRIPTION``
----------------------------

**Optional**

Default: 2

Number of threads that will be consumed for each subscription.
Default behavior of the Google Cloud PubSub library is to use 10 threads per subscription.
We thought this was too much for a default setting and have taken the liberty of
reducing the thread count to 2. If you would like to maintain the default Google PubSub
library behavior, please set this value to 10.
