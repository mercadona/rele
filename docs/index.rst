**Relé** makes integration with Google PubSub easier and is ready to integrate seamlessly into any Django project.

Motivation and Features

The Publish-Subscribe pattern and specifically the Google Cloud PubSub library are very powerful tools but you can easily cut your fingers on it. Relé makes integration seamless by providing Publisher, Subscriber and Worker classes with the following features:

    * A **publish** function
    * A sub decorator to declare subscribers
    * **Publisher** and **Subscription** classes
    * A **Worker** class
    * A **python manage.py runrele** management command
