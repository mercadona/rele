in a pull request. 

Additionally, be sure that you read and follow our 
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mercadona/rele/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

## Code

We ask that you start a discussion before attempting to make a code contribution. For feature 
requests, issues, bugs, etc. please

It is always best to have community input before proposing changes that may later be rejected.

* Run `make lint` on any modified files.
* If your branch is behind master, 
[rebase](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request) on top of it.

## Issues

When you open an issue make sure you include the full stack trace and
that you list all pertinent information (operating system, Python implementation, etc.) 
as part of the issue description.

Please include a minimal, reproducible test case with every bug
report.
